There are two config files to set up:
common.pl (general setup)
spools.pl (mail spool)

config.tlb should be installed to the spool machine(s) ie. to the machine that holds the mail spool dir, that can be this machine or other machine.

run/* is list of scripts that should always run; these are used for management of various spools, best to set up using the 'service' tool
